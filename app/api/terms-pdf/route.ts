Services Provided
SuccessNOW.ai offers AI-powered automation tools, smart websites, marketing systems, lead engagement agents, CRM automation, paid ads management, SEO optimization, and other business growth solutions. These services are integrated into a proprietary system managed entirely by SuccessNOW.

Some elements of the SuccessNOW system may include white-labeled technology solutions provided by third-party vendors, but all services are fully managed, configured, and supported exclusively by SuccessNOW.ai.

Ownership and Access Rights
All websites, funnels, automations, AI agents, CRM systems, campaigns, and software configurations created or implemented by SuccessNOW are proprietary to SuccessNOW.ai.

Upon subscription cancellation, termination, or account closure:
• No data, assets, websites, automations, or technology are transferable to any external provider or platform.
• Access to all SuccessNOW systems and services will be discontinued.
• No refunds or data exports will be provided for proprietary systems.

You retain access only to assets explicitly delivered for download (e.g., PDFs or editable templates) and not to hosted, coded, or automated systems.

Payment Terms
You agree to the pricing and payment schedule presented during onboarding, which may include:
• A one-time setup fee (non-refundable)
• A recurring subscription (monthly or annually)
• Additional service fees for upgrades or support tiers

Failure to maintain active payment may result in service suspension or termination without access to data recovery.

You may cancel your subscription by submitting written notice before your next billing cycle. Cancellation will take effect at the end of the current paid period.

Third-Party Services
While parts of the platform may utilize third-party systems under a white-label arrangement:
• You are contracting exclusively with SuccessNOW.ai
• All integration, customization, hosting, and management are handled by SuccessNOW
• You do not hold any direct license or rights to the underlying third-party technology

We reserve the right to substitute, upgrade, or adjust the underlying technology used in the delivery of services without notice.

Client Responsibilities
You agree to:
• Use the platform for lawful business purposes only
• Provide accurate information for onboarding and support
• Not duplicate, reverse-engineer, extract, or migrate SuccessNOW systems or content to external platforms

Use of the SuccessNOW.ai platform to engage in unethical, deceptive, or illegal activity is grounds for immediate termination.

Termination by SuccessNOW.ai
We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access at any time for violations of these terms, abuse of platform resources, non-payment, or activity that may compromise system integrity.

Upon termination, all services and systems will be deactivated and access to all hosted assets will cease immediately.

No Guarantees
SuccessNOW does not guarantee specific financial results, performance metrics, or ROI. The effectiveness of AI automation, advertising, or SEO tools depends on variables beyond our control, including but not limited to market conditions, client responsiveness, and third-party platform rules.

Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, SuccessNOW shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with the use—or inability to use—our platform or services.

Changes to Terms
We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the SuccessNOW platform after such updates constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.

Governing Law
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands, where SuccessNOW.ai is incorporated.
