AI TECHNOLOGY DISCLOSURE AND DISCLAIMER
SuccessNOW AI employs artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including AI voice and text agents ("AI Agents"), to enhance customer service, respond to inquiries, and provide information about our products and services. By using our services, you acknowledge and agree to the following terms regarding our use of AI Agents:

1. NATURE OF AI INTERACTION
When you interact with our AI Agents, you are communicating with an automated system powered by artificial intelligence, not a human representative. We always identify when you are interacting with an AI Agent rather than a human representative. Our AI Agents are designed to provide helpful, accurate information, but as with any AI technology, there are inherent limitations.

2. AI DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING
Our AI Agents may collect and process the information you provide during interactions, including but not limited to your inquiries, preferences, and feedback. This information is subject to the same privacy protections outlined elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. Additionally:

b. We may use anonymized conversations to train and enhance our AI Agents' capabilities.
c. You can request deletion of your conversation history with our AI Agents by contacting support@successnow.ai

3. AI LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMER
While we strive to ensure our AI Agents provide accurate and helpful information, you acknowledge and agree that:

a. AI technology has inherent limitations and may occasionally provide incomplete, inaccurate, or inappropriate responses.
b. Information provided by our AI Agents is for general informational purposes only and should not be considered professional advice (legal, financial, medical, or otherwise).
c. Critical decisions should not be made solely based on information provided by our AI Agents without appropriate verification.
d. Official company policies, terms, and conditions always supersede any information provided by our AI Agents in case of discrepancies.

4. AI CONTENT GENERATION
Our AI Agents may generate content in response to your queries. You acknowledge that:

a. AI-generated content may not always reflect our official position or advice.
b. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of AI-generated content.
c. SuccessNOW AI reserves the right to review, modify, or remove any AI-generated content at our discretion.

5. LIABILITY LIMITATION FOR AI INTERACTIONS
To the fullest extent permitted by law, SuccessNOW AI disclaims all liability for any damages, losses, or harm arising from:

a. Reliance on information provided by our AI Agents.
b. AI system errors, malfunctions, or unavailability.
c. Decisions made or actions taken based on AI-generated information.
d. Any misunderstandings or miscommunications that may occur during AI interactions.

6. BOT DISCLOSURE
In accordance with applicable laws and regulations, we disclose that our automated agents are bots, and this disclosure is clear, conspicuous, and made at the beginning of any conversation or interaction.

7. AI AGENT OPT-OUT
You may opt-out of interacting with our AI Agents at any time by requesting to speak with a human representative or by using the opt-out mechanisms provided within the communication channel you are using. Please note that opting out of AI interactions may limit the availability or timeliness of certain services.

LEGITIMATE BUSINESS INTERESTS
We may use and process your data for our legitimate business interests, which include, among other things, communicating with you, improving our goods or services, improving our website, and providing you with the information or products that you have requested.

PERFORMANCE OF A CONTRACT
We may use and process your information to enter into a contract with you and to perform our contractual obligations to you.

CONSENT
We may use your data, or permit selected third parties to use your data, based on your consent to our use and sharing of that data. You may withdraw your consent at any time, but doing so may affect your ability to use our website or other offerings.

AS REQUIRED BY LAW
We may also use or process your data as required for us to comply with legal obligations.

INTERNATIONAL DATA
Our website is hosted by servers located in the United States of America. Therefore, if you reside outside the United States of America, some of your data will be transferred internationally to and stored on those servers. In addition, we may use third-party processors (including payment processors) and subcontractors located in the United States of America. We use all reasonable methods to protect the safety of your data during transfer, including hosting our website on reputable servers and engaging reputable third-party processors. By using this site and providing us with information, you consent to this transfer, processing, and storage of your information in the United States of America. Note that the privacy laws in the United States of America may not be as strict as those in other countries.

DATA RETENTION
We retain personal data as long as it is needed to conduct our legitimate business purposes or to comply with our legal obligations, or until you ask us to delete your data. For example, we will retain certain personal information indefinitely for the purposes of maintaining your account, unless and until you delete your account. Data that we gather for a specific and particular purpose, such as assisting law enforcement or analyzing trends, will be kept for no longer than is necessary for that particular purpose. Data that is no longer needed by us for any of the purposes listed above will be permanently deleted.

SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION
We take all reasonable steps to protect your personal data and keep your information secure. We use recognized online secure payment systems and implement generally accepted standards of security to protect against personal data loss or misuse. However, no security measure is foolproof, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against interception or misuse. We cannot guarantee complete security of any information you transmit to us.

SENSITIVE DATA
We request that you do not submit any sensitive data to us, via public postings, email correspondence with us, or any other method, including social security number, health data, genetic data, or information related to your ethnic origin, religious beliefs, or criminal history. If you do send us this information, then by doing so you are consenting to our use, storage, and processing of this information in accordance with this privacy policy.

SMS/TEXT MESSAGE PRIVACY
If you have opted in to receive SMS/text messages from us, we are committed to protecting your privacy regarding these communications:

• No Data Sharing: All text messaging originator opt-in data and consent information will not be shared with any third parties, excluding the aggregators and providers necessary to deliver the SMS service.
• Marketing Restrictions: Your mobile information will not be shared with any third parties or affiliates for marketing or promotional purposes.
• Limited Use: Your SMS opt-in data will only be used for the specific purposes you have consented to, such as appointment reminders, event notifications, receipts, customer service updates, and promotional messages you've explicitly opted into.
• Opt-Out Control: You can stop receiving text messages at any time by texting "STOP" to our shortcode. Upon doing so, we will confirm your opt-out status via SMS and will cease sending you text messages.

YOUR RIGHTS
You have certain rights with respect to your personal data, as outlined below. Note that we may charge you a reasonable fee for actions that you ask us to take with respect to your data. In addition, we reserve the right to request that you provide us with evidence of your identity before we take any action with respect to the exercise of your data rights. Further, your rights may be restricted or nullified to the extent they conflict with our compelling business interests, the public interest, or the law.

UPDATE ACCOUNT INFORMATION
You have the right to update or change any information you have provided to us. To update or delete your information, please contact us at support@successnow.ai

CONFIRM PERSONAL DATA AND ITS USE
You have the right to request that we confirm what data we hold about you, and for what purposes. You also have the right to confirmation of whether we process your data or deliver your data to third-party processors, and for what purposes. We will supply you with copies of your personal data unless doing so would affect the rights and freedoms of others.

CHANGE CONSENT
You have the right to change your consent to our use of your information. In such cases, we may require you to delete your account with us, as described above, and you may not have full access to our website.

REQUEST A COPY OF DATA
You have the right to request a digital copy of the data that we hold about you. Your first request for a copy of your personal data will be provided free of charge; subsequent requests will incur a reasonable fee.

TRANSFER YOUR DATA
You have the right to request that we gather and transfer your data to another controller, in a commonly used and machine-readable format, unless doing so would cause us an undue burden.

DELETE ALL DATA
You have the right to request that we delete all data that we hold about you, and we must delete such data without undue delay. There are exceptions to this right, such as when keeping your data is required by law, is necessary to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information, is required for compliance with a legal obligation, or is necessary for the exercise or defense of legal claims. Such a request may result in a termination of your account with us and you may have limited or no use of our website.

EMAILS AND COMMUNICATIONS
You may opt out of receiving future email correspondence from us by checking the appropriate box when you register for the account or make a purchase. You may change your communication settings by contacting us at support@successnow.ai

MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS
You may opt out of receiving any third-party marketing communications or having your personal information used for marketing purposes. You may do this by contacting us at support@successnow.ai

PROCESSING
You may, in some circumstances, restrict the processing of your data, such as when you contest the accuracy of your data or when you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. When processing has been restricted, we will continue to store your data but will not pass it on to third-party processors without your consent, or as necessary to comply with legal obligations or protect your rights or those of others or our company. In addition, you may opt out of any processing of your data altogether. Note, however, that doing so may result in the termination of your account and loss of access to our website.

COMPLAINTS
If you believe we are misusing your data or have violated any of your rights under this Privacy Policy or applicable law, you have the right to file a complaint with us directly or with a regulatory body or data protection authority.

CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
The State of California has established its own unique regulations that apply to California residents. As of its effective date of January 1, 2020, we are also compliant with the California Consumer Privacy Act Of 2018, Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.100 Et Seq. (CCPA).

Any California resident may request, free of charge, the personal information we have collected or stored about themselves or about a member of their household. For security purposes, we reserve the right to ask for verification of your identity and proof of your California residency at the time of your request.

Any California resident has a right to request the personal data we have collected, or request deletion of the personal data we have collected, including but not limited to:
• Any personally identifying information, such as a real name, alias(es), mailing or resident address, IP address, email address, account name, biometrics, or any other data that could uniquely identify a California resident
• Commercial information, including products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, search history, interactions with our website, or any other purchasing or browsing history of our site and/or offer(s)
• Site comments made publicly or privately
• Geolocation data
• Professional or employment-related information
• Education information

We reserve the right to collect any of the above data on California residents and their households.

We DO NOT sell your data. California residents can email us at support@successnow.ai to explicitly request to opt-out of any future data sales, should our policies change.

California residents also have the option to request a full deletion of their account and any data we have collected and associated with them.

We agree to comply with any data request or deletion made pursuant to the CCPA in a reasonable timeframe, during normal business hours and excluding holidays or our pre-scheduled time off.

COPPA (CHILDREN ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT)
When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.

We do not specifically market to children under 13 and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

FAIR INFORMATION PRACTICES
The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.

In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices, we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:

We will notify the users via email within 7 business days.

We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

CAN SPAM ACT
The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.

We collect your email address in order to:
• Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions
• Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders of our courses, coaching, certifications or marketing services
• Send additional information related to your product and/or service
• Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred

To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:
• NOT use false, or misleading subjects or email addresses
• Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way
• Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters
• Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used
• Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly
• Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email

If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at support@successnow.ai or follow the instructions at the bottom of each email to unsubscribe, and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.
