## 1. Design Philosophy & Technology Stack

The site employs a modern, tech-focused "dark mode" aesthetic designed to convey sophistication and cutting-edge technology.

### Visual Style
-   **Color Palette:**
    -   **Primary Background:** Deep black (`#000000`) and dark navy/charcoal gradients.
    -   **Accent Color:** A vibrant, electric blue (`#00BFFF`) used for CTAs, headlines, icons, and highlights.
    -   **Text:** Primarily white (`#FFFFFF`) and light gray (`#E5E7EB`) for high contrast and readability.
-   **Core Aesthetics:**
    -   **Glassmorphism:** Key elements like cards and popups use a semi-transparent background with a `backdrop-blur` effect.
    -   **Gradients & Glows:** Used extensively in backgrounds, buttons, and borders to add depth and visual interest.
    -   **Animation:** Subtle, persistent animations (like the `StarryBackground`) and on-hover effects create a dynamic and engaging user experience.

### Technology Stack
-   **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router)
-   **Language:** TypeScript
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
-   **UI Components:** shadcn/ui
-   **Icons:** Lucide React
-   **Deployment:** Vercel
